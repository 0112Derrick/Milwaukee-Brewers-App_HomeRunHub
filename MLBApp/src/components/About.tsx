          Baseball, once hailed as America's pastime, has seen a decline in
          popularity in recent years, with some feeling disconnected from the
          game's rich history and slower pace. However, Home Run Hub is on a
          mission to reignite the passion for baseball among fans and teams
          alike. With a fresh approach and innovative features, Home Run Hub
          aims to bring back the excitement and nostalgia of baseball's glory
          days. By providing a platform that offers engaging content,
          interactive experiences, and insightful analysis, Home Run Hub seeks
          to bridge the gap between fans and the sport they love, revitalizing
          the MLB experience for a new generation of enthusiasts.

            Home Run Hub is the passion project of a solo developer, Derrick,
            who works remotely from home. My dedication to the Milwaukee Brewers
            and creating a positive change for individuals, drives me to create
            an application that will excite the baseball world. Despite being a
            team of one, I'm committed to delivering a top-notch experience for
            fans, making it easier for them to access information about their
            favorite teams. I'm a true maker at heart, caring deeply about the
            quality and detail of my work, and I'm determined to make Home Run
            Hub a valuable resource for baseball enthusiasts everywhere.
